description: "Adolphe is a classic French novel by Benjamin Constant, first published\
  \ in 1816. It tells the story of an alienated young man, Adolphe, who falls in love\
  \ with an older woman, Ellénore, the Polish mistress of the Comte de P***. Their\
  \ illicit relationship serves to isolate them from their friends and from society\
  \ at large. The book eschews all conventional descriptions of exteriors for the\
  \ sake of detailed accounts of feelings and states of mind.\nConstant began the\
  \ novel on 30 October 1806, and completed it some time before 1810. While still\
  \ working on it he read drafts to individual acquaintances and to small audiences,\
  \ and after its first publication in London and Paris in June 1816 it went through\
  \ three further editions: in July 1816 (new preface), July 1824 in Paris (restorations\
  \ to Ch. 8, third preface), and in 1828. Many variants appear, mostly alterations\
  \ to Constant's somewhat archaic spelling and punctuation.\n From Wikipedia (CC\
